# CountryGenerator
A python script to generate a basic description of a fictional country.  Yes, it can be a bit weird at times, but it's meant to give you ideas, not do the work for you.

# How to use
First, navigate to the correct version folder.  I only have alpha versions at the moment, so look there.  Download or copy whichever file is the latest, unless you have a reason to do otherwise.

I don't have a compiled version yet, so you'll have to download Python 3.  Run it via the command prompt and almost instantly you have a description of a fictional country!
